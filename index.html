	<h1>This sentence contains ...</h1>

	<p>This is a rough and ready exploration of the high dimensional (26 !!!) space of the sentences which are covered during the course of running this algorithm. The total number of distinct sentences is usually north of 100K, so this display just looks at the sentences in the small set of limit cycles.</p>
	<p>For more info on the algorithm, see the <a href="https://github.com/railsagainstignorance/this-sentence-contains/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>
